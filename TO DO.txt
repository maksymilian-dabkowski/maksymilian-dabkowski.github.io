TO DO.txt
  - Add our "Large language models and (non-)linguistic recursion" paper and change the description of the project to include the contributions of the paper.
  - Update the figure in the Discontinuous vowel harmony in Gu√©bie section to reflect our current analysis (from the Language submission written largely by Emily).
  - Perhaps change the Sans Serif font of the entire website to Noto Sans.
  - Perhaps replace the Yucatec Maya multiple inheritance matrix with an AVM?
  - Should I also post my P-interest talk handout?
