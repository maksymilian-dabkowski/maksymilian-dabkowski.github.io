TO DO.txt
  - Add "manuscript(_lingbuzz)" or "postprint" to the Phonology article on A'ingae stress dominance?
  - Move the LLM project above the historical project, since this is a more recent submission.
  - Replacce the graphic for large language models with something more distinct, like an instance of recursion. Perhaps the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle?
  - Perhaps replace graphic for diphthongs and their changes with a Q-theoretic tableau. (Or keep the time axis and also add the tableau?)
  - Should I also post my P-interest talk handout?
