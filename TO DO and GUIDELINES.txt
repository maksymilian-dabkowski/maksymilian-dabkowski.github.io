TO DO
  - Add "manuscript(_lingbuzz)" or "postprint" to the Phonology article on A'ingae stress dominance? 
  - Move the LLM project above the historical project, since this is a more recent submission.
  - Replacce the graphic for large language models with something more distinct, like an instance of recursion. Perhaps the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle?
  - Perhaps replace graphic for diphthongs and their changes with a Q-theoretic tableau. (Or keep the time axis and also add the tableau?)
  - Should I also post my P-interest talk handout?

GUIDELINES
  1. Only include the most recent versions of research, and things which have been published (including proceedings from conferences, even if they are not the most up to date).
    a. Take down older versions of presentations that do not represent the most up to date version of the project.
  2. Perhaps I can include "postprints" for all major published papers (in addition to actual links to papers).
  3. Do not include abstracts and handouts (if there are papers) or recordings of talks.
    a. However, do include alternative media, such a slides or posters.
