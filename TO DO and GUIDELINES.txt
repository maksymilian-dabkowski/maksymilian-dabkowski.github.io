TO DO
  – maybe: Remove the indentation of A'ingae projects in the research list (doesn't look good given the expaded things around it)
  — Change the graphic for the diphthongs section with something that reflects my revised understanding of the timeline of changes?
  — Add additional pictures to the Miscellaneous section
  — change the Linguistic Inquiry link on the home page after the paper gets officially accepted
  — Add another graphic to the PG section (now the bottom half is kinda empty)? Perhaps a tableau showing the statisfaction of the exhaustivity constraint (something inspired by https://padlet-uploads.storage.googleapis.com/1367392511/07d9d6c5fcd52d6407c007bf58c32e36/Prosody_drives_Paraguayan_Guaran__suffix_order___a_presentation_poster__2_.pdf)
  — Replace all my published articles on lingbuzz with the published version of the open access articles? (e.g. Phonology, NLLT, etc.)
  — Put negative nominalizations handout on lingbuzz and link on my website to it?
  — Remove the papers from the research folder that are not linked to by anything.
  — Add "manuscript(_lingbuzz)" or "postprint" to the Phonology article on A'ingae stress dominance?

GUIDELINES
  1. Only include the most recent versions of research.
    a. Do not include proceedings paper if there are full research papers developed on their basis.
  2. Perhaps I can include "postprints" for all major published papers (in addition to actual links to papers).
  3. Do not include abstracts and handouts (if there are papers) or recordings of talks.
    a. However, do include alternative media, such a slides or posters.
